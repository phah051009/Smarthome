            <h3>The JBL Bar 1300 is the only soundbar we've tested that really gives you surround sound. But to which
                Award?
            </h3>

            <img src="./../blogg/jbl/jbl1.jpg" alt="Picture on the speakers" class="bloggbild">

            <p>When all soundbar manufacturers talk about Atmos and surround, you should take it with a big pinch of salt. You
                will never get surround sound with just a soundbar and a subwoofer, no matter how many speakers
                they are squeezed in it and regardless of whether they shoot sound upwards, to the sides or whatever it may be. It is
                marketing lingo alone. And quite a deceptive one.
            </p>

            <p>As I said, Atmos is available in cinemas and the sound is fantastic. But don't believe that for a moment
                is just a sound loaf and a bass box that accounts for the sound. When I quickly google, I get the following answer
                from SF "A movie theater usually has a woofer and five or seven surround speakers, which together
                creates a sound that surrounds the spectator. In addition to the bass speaker (subwoofer), Dolby Atmos has a large number
                environment speakers spread over the entire salon and also an almost equal number of speakers in
                the roof.”
            </p>

            <p>You guys are sharks, right? Sure, a soundbar produces better sound than the TV's speakers, but surround? Hardly. Although it
                there are exceptions. The JBL Bar 1300 is one such. It's technically a soundbar and a subwoofer. But as
                we
            </p>

            <h3>Detachable speakers</h3>

            <p>The external speakers on the soundbar are removable and can be placed behind you as satellite speakers and –
                whoops! – you have surround sound! But how much surround sound? I turn on Star Wars: Rouge One and the sound
                is absolutely cracking! The substantial subwoofer, 10-inch bass element, makes the room shake
                while the removable speakers, equipped with rechargeable batteries, which are enough for about ten
                hours of listening, creates a truly enveloping feeling. Fucking Atmos, here I come! Finally! I'm placing
                on the latest Predator reel Prey and let me be crushed, in a nice way, by the sound.
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/jbl/jbl2.jpg" alt="Picture showing how the speakers look when you remove them from the soundbar."
                class="bloggbild">

                <p>The detachable satellite speakers can also be used as standalone bluetooth speakers if you want to take them with you
                    you music for the kitchen.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Cracking cinema sound</h3>
    
                <p>Limpan's three main speakers in combination with a total of six upward-facing speaker elements, a subwoofer and
                    two detachable surround speakers provide 1,170 watts and a real cinema feel. An automatic sound calibration
                    ensures that the sound is adapted to the room. Hand on heart, I couldn't hear any difference before
                    and after calibration. In any case, the speaker configuration is 11.1.4. And it sounds good.
                    Best of all the sound loaves I've tested.
                </p>
    
                <p>JBL Bar 1300 is connected to the TV via hdmi earc and has support for 4k Dolby Vision passthrough. There is
                    then three HDMI inputs to connect video games and more. A small discreet display tells you which one
                    connection in use.
                </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/jbl/jbl3.jpg" alt="Picture showing the inputs on the sound bar" class="bloggbild">
            <p>Of course there is also an app to use. In it there is an equalizer that is very easy to use,
                possibility to set the volume on the satellite speakers, sound synchronization and other little things.
                The remote control is simple and functional. You can easily change the strength of bass, treble as well
                the satellite speakers.
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/jbl/jbl4.jpg" alt="The image shows the associated base for the system" class="bloggbild">
            <p>If you want good surround sound without running a lot of cables, then there is no sound bar that can do it
                here. In fact, this is the only sound bar that gives you true surround sound, and it's expensive. Wants
                you have JBL Bar 1300, you have to cough up almost 17,000 kroner. But not to recommend this one would be
                criminal!
