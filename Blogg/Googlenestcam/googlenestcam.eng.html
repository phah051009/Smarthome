            <h3>Google's Nest Cam is a feature-rich camera that stands up to the competition.</h3>
            <img src="./../blogg/googlenestcam/googlenestcam1.jpg" alt="Image of the surveillance camera when it is mounted outdoors."
                class="bloggbild">

                <p>The Google Nest Cam is a bit like a mix of the Arlo Essential Spotlight Camera and recently tested Google
                    Nest Doorbell. In terms of appearance, it is most reminiscent of the Arlo camera and just like this is the Google Nest Cam
                    intended for both outdoor and indoor use. However, it does have something like the Arlo Essential Spotlight Camera
                    missing, namely magnetic mounts. However, it lacks Arlo's built-in spotlight.
                </p>
    
                <p>Functionally, it is more reminiscent of the Google Nest Doorbell, not least because these two cameras use
                    of the same app (the Google Home app).
                </p>

                <h3>Easy to install and easy to use</h3>

                <p>Installing the Google Nest Cam is, apart from screwing up the wall plate, very quick and
                    smooth. The camera can be operated completely wirelessly if you choose battery operation, which makes it even easier
                    the placement of it.
                </p>

                <p>If, on the other hand, you want to have a power cord connected, it becomes a little trickier. Included in the package comes only a pitiful one
                    one meter cord, but longer (and more weatherproof) cords can be purchased separately.
                </p>
    
                <p>Unfortunately, the Google Nest Cam does not have a removable battery, so you must take down and charge the entire camera when
                    the battery is running out. But thanks to the magnetic attachment, it is easy to do this in any case.
                </p>
    
                <p>Once the camera is in place, just add it to the app (Google Home), then you
                    started. Google Nest Cam also doesn't need to connect to any hub, just connect to yours
                    existing Wi-Fi networks.
                </p>
    
                <p>Just like its sibling Google Nest Doorbell, the Google Nest Cam has everything you could wish for in terms of functionality
                    one. Here you can find everything from the ability to set motion sensitivity, selected motion zones and
                    identification of different types of movement (people, animals, vehicles, etc.) to battery saving functions
                    and choosing which types of notices you want to receive, as well as when and how they should be sent.
                </p>

                <h3>Messy app</h3>

                <p>Google Nest Cam also uses, for better or worse, the Google Home app. Just like for the Nest Doorbell
                    are the advantages that the app is entirely in Swedish and that it is easy to integrate other products into the app,
                    whether they come from Google or not.
                </p>
    
                <p>But the downside is that Google Home is not the most easy-to-use app, with a somewhat messy interface.
                </p>
    
                <p>And as with the Google Nest Doorbell (and most other cameras these days), a paid subscription is required for
                    to be able to make full use of Google Nest Cam.
                </p>
    
                <p>The subscription is called Nest Aware and costs SEK 55 a month. You then get 30 days of video history for
                    events (instead of the three hours included for free) and access to features such as
                    facial recognition. There is also a subscription called Nest Aware Plus which costs SEK 110 a month
                    gives you 60 days of video history of events. Both of these subscriptions are valid for an unlimited number
                    cameras.
                </p>

                <h3>Okay image quality </h3>

                <p>Google Nest Cam has a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels and a viewing angle of 130 degrees
                    diagonally, which are exactly the same numbers as the Arlo Essential Spotlight Camera.
                </p>
    
                <p>And just like this one, the image quality of the Google Nest Cam is just fine. Compared to Arlos a little more
                    advanced (and more expensive) cameras, however, it does not have much to contend with in terms of quality.
                </p>
    
                <p>The Arlo Essential Spotlight Camera also has the advantage of having a built-in spotlight, which gives it a little something
                    better image quality at night compared to Google Nest Cam.
                </p>
    
                <p>In contrast, the Google Nest Cam does not suffer from any delay, either when you want to start one
                    live streaming from the camera or when something happens in front of the camera.
                </p>
    
                <p>Finally, the Google Nest Cam gets a slight minus for the price tag, which (at least compared to the Arlo Essential
                    Spotlight Camera) is a bit high. On the other hand, you get a slightly sharper surveillance camera too
                    the money.
                </p>
