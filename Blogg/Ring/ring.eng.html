            <h3>A loud outdoor siren is the biggest change that the Ring Alarm 2.0 alarm system has undergone.</h3>            
            <img src="./../blogg/ring/ring1.jpg" alt="Picture showing what the alarm panel looks like" class="bloggbild">

            <p><b>Tested product:</b> Ring Alarm 2.0</p>
            <p><b>Price:</b> SEK 2,799 at Amazon Sweden</p>

            <p>Ring is diligent in updating its product lines, which is not least noticeable in the number
                video doorbells on the market (seven at the time of writing). It is therefore not a big surprise
                that they are launching a 2.0 version of their alarm package just over six months after the first package
                was released.
            </p>

            <h3>Everything has become smaller</h3>

            <p>Most of the components basically have the same functions as before and the most noticeable difference is that
                most things have become slightly smaller.
            </p>

            <p>Of the five parts included in the basic package, the base station is the same and the range extender basically has
                same size but new design. However, the keypad, motion detector and contact sensor have all shrunk
                something.
            </p>

            <p>The keypad has also been redesigned and fitted with three new buttons. With these buttons it is possible to
                manually activate an alarm siren or send a notification to three preset contacts. As before goes
                it also to activate or deactivate the alarm with three different modes; Disarmed, Home and Away. The buttons
                for these have been made clearer and easier to press.
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/ring/ring2.jpg" alt="The image shows all devices included in the starter kit" class="bloggbild">

            <p>The fact that the news is few certainly does not do much, as Ring Alarm was already functioning well in the first
                the version. But it's a bit of a shame that all the negatives we had in our first test remain.
                Admittedly, the price has decreased somewhat (2,799 kroner now compared to previously 3,300 kroner), but the limited
                the setting options and the need for a paid subscription to get full functionality are
                still there.
            </p>

            <h3>Loud and ugly outdoor siren</h3>

            <p>The big news is instead the launch of a complementary outdoor siren, the Ring Alarm Outdoor Siren.
                Large both figuratively and literally, as it measures 23.5 x 23.5 x 5.7 centimeters and weighs a whopping 1.3
                kilo (including batteries). The siren is mounted outdoors on the facade and howls (up to just over 100 dB) and
                then flashes red when an alarm is triggered upon detected motion/intrusion (or if you manually trigger
                the alarm).
            </p>

            <p>Installing it is tricky, as a certain amount of measuring, drilling and screwing is required. If you settle for
                pure battery operation is easier, but if you want to connect power it becomes trickier.
            </p>

            <p>Once in place, the Ring Alarm Outdoor Siren works just as easily and smoothly as the other Ring components
                The alarm system. It is possible to set how loud it should sound (four different modes) and how long it should last
                let (from one to ten minutes). And of course also when and how it should be activated.
            </p>
            <p>Ring Alarm Outdoor Siren works well, does what it is supposed to and is a welcome addition to the siren that
                is built into the base station. The only objection we have is to its appearance.
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/ring/ring3.jpg" alt="Picture on outdoor siren" class="bloggbild">

            <p>For Ring has chosen to shape it as a giant version of their baby blue logo. A logo that honestly
                is not very pretty. We understand that the idea is probably that this blue lump should have a deterrent
                purpose and warn that "here is the alarm", but to at least have been able to choose a color using different
                stickers would have been desirable.
                Now it is a large and baby blue octagon on the facade that applies and nothing else.
            </p>
