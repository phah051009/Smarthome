    <p>Who doesn't want to be able to get up in the morning and have the curtains automatically rolled up, the coffee machine put on and
        favorite playlist sounding at perfect volume from the speakers? Or maybe sit down on the couch after a long one
        working day and watch the TV automatically start our favorite series, while the lighting is optimized for
        watching TV without us having to press a single button.

    <b>Tested hubs</b>
    <p>Google Nest Hub</p>
    <p>Samsung Smartthings</p>
    <p>Animus Heart</p>
    <p>Fibaro Home Center 3</p>
    <p>Athom Homey 2.0</p>
    <p>Logitech Harmony</p>

    <p>Until not so long ago, these scenarios were reserved for science fiction or the real world
        the automation geeks. Today when more and more connected gadgets are available to any consumer
        are the resources there for us ala to get started and automate our home</p>

    <h3>Control the whole home with the same app</h3>

    <p>Anyone who has ever sat down and tried to realize this flexible, technology-filled existence knows that it is not
        It's always so easy to get the gadgets talking to each other. With more and more fun smart home gadgets to fill
        our houses with there is a space in the market for so-called control units or hubs.</p>
    <br>

<p>These act as a connection center for all our connected curtains, lights, fans, heat pumps, and more.
         With the associated app, we can easily control all devices at the same time and set up smart scenes where each gadget
         behave exactly as we want automatically.</p>
     <br>
     <p>A well-functioning hub must therefore be able to control all of your smart gadgets. Here there are slightly different protocols
         that smart devices use. In addition to the technologies that we have known since before, such as wi-fi, bluetooth and
         infrared light, the protocols Z-Wave and Zigbee have also become big on the market. The more protocols your hub
         supports, the more potential it has to control your entire smart home.</p>

     <h3>Different hubs for different purposes</h3>
     <p>There are several aspects to look out for when it comes to choosing the right controller for your smart home,
         as hubs target different types of users. Maybe you're just looking for a smooth way to in the same
         interface to control all your smart lighting, or are you looking for a hub that lets you create more
         advanced automation scenes?</p>
     <br>
     <p>Perhaps the answer is that you need two different controllers for different purposes. Several of the hubs in this test
         for example, complement each other really well, as one of them can offer broad compatibility with, for example
         many different products, and another has invested in advanced automation options in the software.</p>
    
         <h3>So we did the test</h3>
         <p>In our test, we have selected six of the most popular smart control units that have been launched in the Swedish language
             market and which can be used to connect and control your smart home. They all have different characteristics and
             functions have different price range.</p>
    
         <br>
         <p>The controllers have been tested in the same apartment with a set of different smart lights, sockets, media players and
             sensors. We've rated them based on how well they do what they claim to do, affordability, compatibility
             and ease of use.</p>

    <p>Nest Hub is an affordable and easy-to-use hub that is perfect for technology enthusiasts as well as your parents.
        But even though it works great as a control unit and offers unique functions compared to its competitors, it lacks
        it fully automation functions. The unstable experience further contributes to it not really being one
        full score in our eyes.</p>

    <p>Despite its frugal exterior, Smartthings Hub hides really smart and flexible functions under the chassis. With
        many different connection possibilities, a user-friendly interface and really good automation possibilities are
        this a really genius little puck. With the fact that it is also the cheapest model we have tested can
        we can't help but give it a full pot!</p>

    <p>Animus Heart is a really nice option for seasoned automation geeks as well as smart newbies

    <p>For those of you who are looking for a hub that can connect a fantastic number of gadgets at the same time, which also covers large houses
        and which has the capacity to do it really quickly and smoothly, Fibaro is a good option. Right now is Home
        However, Center 3 is so new that many of the functionalities have not arrived yet, such as Zigbee support and functions in
        the app. This combined with its high price means that we cannot recommend Home Center 3 right now, but we hope so
        see updates on the software front that allow us to take advantage of this massive performance.</p>

    <p>Athom Homey is undeniably one of the most multifunctional hubs we've come across, but also one of the most expensive. All

    <p>Logitech Harmony is fantastic for a very specific target group: home theater geeks. It is primarily thought for you
        who want to throw away your hundreds of controls and control the entire home theater with one and the same device. Because this works
        the really good, but with, to say the least, a lack of support for smart home gadgets and no Zigbee and Z-Wave support
