            <h3>Verisure's alarms have developed a lot in the past year and several parts we previously mentioned have
                fixed. This is Sweden's best home alarm right now.
            </h3>

            <img src="./../blogg/verisure/verisure1.jpg" alt="Picture showing what the home alarm looks like" class="bloggbild">

            <p>Verisure offers a number of different packages depending on your needs, and unlike many competitors
                they offer both free calls and professional installation and review of the system. You need
                simply just watch as everything installs which is convenient, although it's also a reason to
                the system costs a lot.
            </p>

            <h3>Expandable with smart accessories</h3>

            <p>The package we start from in the test is called Smart Voice Alarm and consists of the basic components you
                expect from a modern alarm. With great possibilities to expand. New for this year is the new one
                the alarm panel. It is considerably larger than its predecessor, but then it also has a built-in siren and speakers too
                two-way communication with Verisure. So you don't have to plug in a separate voice unit.
            </p>

            <p>It is of course possible to get away cheaper, but the supplier does not have an open price list on the site, without the
                would rather contact you to negotiate an offer depending on how and where you live - as well as
                what needs you have. We think it's a bit ugly, but Verisure is not alone in that arrangement.
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/verisure/verisure2.jpg" alt="Picture of the arlo camera which is compatible with the alarm" class="bloggbild">

            <p>In addition to the gadgets in the basic package, we have tested a large number of extra accessories in the form of IP cameras (for
                indoor and outdoor use), Yale Doorman module, remote switch (smartplug), security panel,
                climate sensor and leak sensor.
            </p>

            <p>The possibilities to expand the system are almost endless and all functions work really well. With
                You never need to alarm the Yale module - it is done automatically when you unlock the door lock. We tested
                the integration with the latest Yale Doorman L3 and the lock works much easier in Verisure's system than when you
                using Yale software.
            </p>

            <p>By combining sensors from your various devices, you can set up a smart home there, for example
                the element in the friggebod starts up when it approaches freezing temperatures. Extremely flexible! We tested to and
                with controlling a terrarium (temperature and humidity) by using a climate sensor (i
                the terrarium) in combination with three different remote switches connected to the heating lamp, heating loop and
                humidifier. The possibilities are huge when you set up automations, even if the actual overview of yours
                macros quickly become hard to grasp and after a while it's easy to forget how you set yours
                lights, what happens when the sun goes down and what your schedule looks like for your smart lock. Here are
                surface space for improvement in the interface.
            </p>

            <h3>Arlo cameras provide added value</h3>

            <p>For some time now, Arlo's outdoor cameras have been used in Verisure's system. We have tested several
                different Arlo cameras for a long time and they work perfectly with the same functionality as from a regular one
                Arlo account. However, not all models are supported if you intend to connect existing cameras to your alarm account.
                For example Arlo Go 2 has not yet received support. However, you can now use Arlo Pro 4, which gives a very good image
                and functionality. You also don't have to pay for Arlo's extra services, these are included in the purchase when you
                connects the cameras to the Verisure account.
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/verisure/verisure4.jpg" alt="Image showing how the app looks" class="bloggbild">

            <p>The interface of the Verisure app is clean and clear, you can quickly see the status of your system.
                Here you can also see information such as temperature, humidity, and many other useful things if you bought more
                other smart accessories. Perfect winter time to get an overview of the indoor climate.
            </p>

            <p>A relatively new feature in the app is Verisure Guardian. Here, wherever you are, you can use the app
                as a contact alarm in the mobile phone. On the one hand, there is a built-in SOS service, and on the other hand you can set up when you expect
                you stay at home with the Check on me function. If you are not home in time, the contact alarm is activated and sent
                your last known position to the alarm center.
            </p>

            <p>We tested the service and when the timer counts down to zero, Verisure calls repeatedly and speaks out in
                the speaker unit at home to see if everything is okay. At the same time, guards are sent to the mobile's position. The
                there is also the option to activate a silent alarm, a function that is good to have if you are exposed, for example
                for domestic violence but do not want to reveal that you sent an alarm.
            </p>

            <p>Verisure's alarm system can easily cost you a fortune if you go all in, but it's also more than just a
                standard home alarm. Recommended!
            </p>
