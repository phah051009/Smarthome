            <h3>With the Philips wireless lighting system Hue, you can control your lights via an app, regardless of
                where you are you. We have tested the starter kit and a bunch of new accessories.</h3>

            <p>Smart LED lights that turn on and off via a touch on the mobile screen are available in a multitude of
                different variants, and it there are even light bulbs with built-in speakers. However, no manufacturer
                has come as far in developments such as Philips and their Hue series, which includes a range of different lighting
                solutions the home.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="./../blogg/philipshue/Philipshue1.jpg"
                alt="A woman sitting and reading in the light of the lamps" class="bloggbild">
            <br>
            <p>There are several starter kits to choose from depending on your needs. Common to all of them is that
                the includes a so-called bridge that is connected to your router. It then takes care of the
                communication, with the lights. IN ours case, we brought in the White Ambience Start Kit, which contains two lamps (E27, large base only
                white light), a bridge and a wireless dimmer switch. As a complement, we also brought in two lamps with a
                small base (E14), and which can also change color. We also tested the system together with Apple Homekit and a
                number of different ones sensors and switches from Fibaro, as well as with the IFTTT app. </p>
            <br>
            <p>As soon as you have installed the app, the search for base station and lights starts. The interface is
                really nice and the layout is logical. Once the lights are found, you can then group them and name the cluster after
                them room you installed them in - for example living room, hall, bedroom and so on. It is just as easy to
                separate the units and rename them if you want to physically move them to another room. The layout is not so
                similar about how a multiroom shstem with speakers works, but the question is whether or not Philips draws the
                longest straw when the applies to ease of use. Really good. </p>

                alt="An image showing the different settings available in the app" class="bloggbild">
            <br>
            <p>In the app you can then set the brightness and which type of light you want to use at the moment -
                from warm relaxing light to bright white light. You can also use the timer function to set the lights to
                switch on and off at a certain point in time. Also from a security point of view, there are of course advantages
                if it always looks as if someone is home. Another advantage is that Philips Hue is compatible with Amazon, Alexa, Apple Homekit
                and Google Home, which, among other things, enables voice control. It is actually extremely convenient to be able
                to say "Turn off the house" to siri and watch all the lights go out. Or "Turn on the overhead light in the kitchen." </p>

            <h3>All-in requires new switches</h3>
            <p>The downside to Philips Hue, if you want to go all-in, is that the solution requires your old analog
                switches to be on the whole the time. If someone in the home accidentally turns off a light with the light switch on the wall, you
                will not be able to access it in the app. And when we turn it back on, it doesn't remember that you may have dimmed the lamp or changed the color. The
                solution is of course you moving to using associated wireless switches, and perhaps even motion detectors. Or that you
                complements your Hue system with some switches from e.g. Fibaro behind your switches so that they work
                together in e.g Apple Homekit.</p>

            <p>You can also use Philips Hue together with IFTTT, which opens up a lot of exciting possibilities
                possibility. For example, lighting a lamp in a certain color and the manager emails you. Or turn off the whole house
                automatically when you (your smartphone) leave home. </p>

            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p>We are completely sold on Philips Hue and after using the system for a few weeks it feels foreign
                to go back to how it was before. It is incredibly easy to use, and the possibilities to
                customize yours lighting is great. Up to fifty lights and twelve accessories can be connected to each bridge
                (dimming, motion sensors, and so on) But if it tastes good, it costs - each extra lamp costs
                from 150 SEK up to over SEK 500, depending on the frame and whether we want to be able to change the color or
                not.</p>
