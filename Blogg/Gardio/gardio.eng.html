            <h3>Gardios larmsystem är prisvärt, men saknar några önskvärda funktioner.</h3>

            <img src="./../blogg/gardio/gardio1.jpg" alt="Picture showing how part of the home alarm is structured" class="bloggbild">

            <p>For better or for worse, Gardio uses a camera-based alarm system only. A number of cameras are deployed
                in key places in the home - for example towards front doors, balconies or windows where you can get in -
                and then alerts if motion is detected.
            </p>

            <p>You get a notification on your mobile, can see the pictures that were taken when the movement was detected (and also live pictures from
                the cameras) and then decides for himself what the next action should be. Should you call 112 (in case of an ongoing
                burglary) and/or activate the guard service included in the subscription? Or do nothing
                because it was just a false alarm that needs no action?
            </p>

            <h3>Easy to install and use</h3>

            <p>One of the advantages of Gardio 2.0 being camera-based is that it is very easy to install and
                get started with. You just choose strategic locations for the cameras, attach them with the pre-mounted ones
                self-adhesive velcro straps (or screw them up if you want them to stick properly
                properly), plug in the power cord and connect the cameras to the network, wirelessly or with a
                network cable. After downloading the app and creating an account, you are then up and running. Any
                central unit, hub or similar is not needed.
            </p>

            <p>And should you encounter problems during the installation, Gardio has a very fast and
                competent support service that can be reached both via e-mail and telephone.
            </p>

            <p>What could possibly be a bit tricky and impractical here is the power supply. Admittedly included
                really long cords to reach the nearest electrical outlet, but a completely wireless, battery-powered one
                alternative would have been desirable for greater flexibility.
            </p>

            <p>Once in place, Gardio 2.0 is very easy to use. The alarm system can be accessed both via the app
                or a web interface and you can see the camera feed in real time, see images and history from the past
                events, as well as change the settings of both the cameras and the system at large. It is also possible, of course,
                to quickly set the alarm on or off.
            </p>

            <h3>Missing features</h3>

            <p>Unfortunately, this is also where Gardio's weaknesses begin to show. Because even if the system is easy to use and flexible
                by and large, it's a bit unpedagogical and messy when it comes to settings. The cameras are also quite
                slow in the response when you try to align them via the remote control and a lot of fiddling is required
                before they are directed as you want them.
            </p>

            <p>This toughness is also noticeable when you follow the cameras' live stream. There is a delay of several
                seconds and the cameras also chop and lag significantly. However, this does not affect anything
                the motion detection and the alarm function.
            </p>

            <p>Worse is the lack of complementary accessories and functions. Admittedly, there are extra cameras,
                water alarm, fire alarm, battery backup and external siren to buy, but it would have been desirable
                for example motion sensors and contact sensors for doors and windows. It would also have been good about that
                there were alarms for sound and not just for motion in the image.
            </p>

            <p>In terms of price, however, Gardio 2.0 stands up well. The starting cost of SEK 2,240 for a package with two cameras is
                absolutely fine, the same with the monthly cost of SEK 200 with an included guard service. Not directly
                cheap maybe, but in any case worth it.
            </p>
