            <h3>The speaker currently on everyone's lips: the multiroom speaker Sonos Era 300 with six built-in elements
                directed in different directions promises a listening experience called duga. We've tested!</h3>

            <p>Sonos Era is a solid piece with a match weight of 4.47 kilos. The design can obviously be experienced by some
                as somewhat doubtful: "Does it really look like that?" is the first comment I am served from one
                curious acquaintance who wants to view the manufacturer's latest creation. He is referring to the hourglass-like shape
                which is undeniably special. According to Sonos, the acoustic construction is optimized to deliver a
                as spacious and enveloping as possible, so you just have to like the position - if, like me, you are
                somewhat skeptical of the design.
            </p>

            <p>It thus becomes something of a challenge to bestow the speaker with optimal placement, above all in view of
                that it should have a free play space of at least 20 centimeters all around.
            </p>

            <h3>High quality feeling</h3>

            <p>Just as always with products from Sonos, the feeling of quality in the finish is high.
                The speaker cabinet's matte white surface is pleasant to the touch. At the front edge on the top of the speaker is
                a longer, sunken slider used to adjust the volume, as well as a bunch of accurate touch-sensitive ones
                buttons with which you activate the voice control service, change tracks and pause or resume
                the playback. Sweet!
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/sonosera300/sonosera3002.jpg" alt="Picture of the back of the speaker.">

            <p>Just like on the recently released sibling Era 100, there is a usb-c port on the back which can be used to
                via 3.5 mm aux cable connect an external audio source alternatively to connect the speaker via
                network cable to your router. There is also a button to turn the microphone on/off. Like everyone
                multiroom speakers, stable wireless communication is of the utmost importance: the Era 300 supports Wi-Fi 6
                (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax 2.4 or 5 GHz) as well as bluetooth (5.0) if for some reason you prefer it.
            </p>

            <h3>Easy installation, user-friendly interface</h3>

            <p>Installing Sonos speakers is a no-brainer, and so is the Era 300. Once you've fitted it with
                power it appears in the app, follow the instructions and it's done. If you have a Sonos configuration, it is
                just place the speaker in one of your existing rooms and proceed to various settings for
                as good a listening experience as possible.
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/sonosera300/sonosera3003.jpg" alt="image of what the sonos app looks like" class="bloggbild">

            <p>For optimal playback quality, use the "Trueplay" function to set
                playback sound. You can choose between a quick or a more advanced adjustment, where the former
                also works for Android users. For the more advanced adjustment, as before, an IOS device is required.
            </p>

            <h3>Angled speaker elements</h3>

            <p>In the app there is a lot more to be done before you are set to go. If you want to voice control the speaker is
                it applies to Sonos' own assistant, Sonos Voice, or Amazon Alexa. Then it's time to add
                possible music services, in and of themselves not necessary as the speaker supports Airplay 2 as well
                Spotify Connect, but if you want everything collected in the Sonos app, there is still the option and most of the big ones
                the suppliers are represented. In the app, as in all Sonos speakers, you can adjust both bass and
                treble, for the Era 300 also the height of the sound, likewise if it should automatically identify and play back spatially
                (spacious) sound.</p>

            <img src="./../blogg/sonosera300/sonosera3004.jpg" alt="Picture showing how the speaker is built" class="bloggbild">

            <h3>A fantastic sound experience</h3>

            <p>The equipment in the Era 300 consists of six digital class d amplifiers, two woofers angled to the left
                and right respectively to provide support for stereo sound as well as four tweeters – one forward-facing, two side-facing
                as well as an upward, placed in a directional horn to reflect the sound towards the ceiling when playing
                Dolby Atmos content.
            </p>

            <p>In other words, there is a lot of technology here and it is not because a lot of expectations are built up
                when it's time for the speaker to declare a suit. My invited guests and I are looking for a couple
                spatial track on Amazon Music (Unilimited) and prepares us for an experience out of the ordinary. Trust case
                with Pink kicks off the bonanza and sure enough it sounds fantastic. The soundscape is wide and enveloping and I
                no need to look for a specific sweet spot, it sounds just as good no matter where in the room I place myself.
                Wow, like!
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/sonosera300/sonosera3005.jpg" alt="Comparison between Era 100 and Era 300 in terms of size" class="bloggbild">

            <p>We continue with I'm Good with David Guetta and Bebe Rexta and the result is the same... magically good!
                The bass reproduction is captivating and the mid-range is rudely accurate. Track after track and Era
                300 continues to deliver!
            </p>

            <p>I turn off the spatial function to compare and it sounds...just as good! I shift back and forth though
                neither I nor any of my guests can notice any difference whatsoever. Ok, shit the same – sounds like it
                well, that sounds good, but the mind is certainly starting to wander; have we done something wrong, the files are not
                compatible with spacious sound? Well, everything is correct and even when we feed the speaker with the same track, but as
                lacks support for Dolby Atmos, it sounds just as good. What exactly is the deal with spatial sound?
            </p>

            <h3>More to look forward to</h3>

            <p>As for home theater sound, fine, I understand and when we get another copy of the Era 300 we will
                it will be really exciting to test them as surround speakers and in a true stereo configuration, with
                separated left and right channels. How good will that sound?
            </p>

            <p>As a single speaker tasked with playing music, the Era 300 performs superbly, with a soundstage
                wider than a barn wall, but if it has to do with spatial sound is currently impossible for me
                to decide.
            </p>

            <p>The grading is tricky in this case, just under 6,000 kroner for a speaker is a heck of a lot
                money and given that I was not able to fully test the concept – two units as a stereo pair or
                as surround speakers in a home cinema setup – it's even more difficult. At the same time, Era 300 has served
                some of the best sound experiences I've ever experienced from a single multiroom speaker.
            </p>
