            <h3>Glue is not the best lock technically, but certainly good enough. However, that's only if you live on the right
                place that it gets really interesting.</h3>

            <p><b>Tested product:</b> Glue Smart Door Lock Pro</p>
            <p><b>Price, April 2023</b> From SEK 1,390 via Prisjakt</p>

            <p>When we tested the Glue Smart Lock V2 a couple of years ago, it was a promising system with some
                childhood diseases, such as much lived on its smart bonus service Inhome for automatic home deliveries. A bid could set
                the goods on the hall carpet for you, maybe even sort the food in the fridge, even if you weren't home. It was also
                then very limited geographically, but we hoped it would really take off.
            </p>

            <p>How has it gone on that point? Well, a little this and that. It is still a service that is very
                geographically limited. A postcode search function is available on the Glue Homes site, where you can see if you have any
                delivery options where you live. We try with postcodes in several Swedish cities and only get hits in
                Greater Stockholm and in Gothenburg's inner city. There may be more, but the development of accessibility since
                two years ago is not huge. A major partner, Mathem.se, also left Inhome earlier this year.
            </p>

            <p>It is primarily DHL that is a major partner now, and then with DHL Home Delivery from selected customers
                online stores. But also, for example, deliveries from Best are available at a few postcodes we find. The service
                works smoothly if you live right and order in the right way. WE tested a DHL delivery. Immediately after ordering
                a notice came in the app and we had to approve a temporary key for the bid, which when they arrived unlocked, set
                the package just before the door, pulled again and locked it behind him.
            </p>

            <p>It is of course up to you if you are comfortable with letting people inside the threshold when you are not
                at home, but since at least the DHL deliveries are videotaped and insured, there is a certain security. And
                at least the delivery was 100% professional. Does it feel like something for you and you live where it is
                In-home deliveries, Glue can be the key for you.
            </p>

            <h3>Same design as before</h3>

            <p>If not, Glue is still a fully functional lock, albeit not the most technologically advanced. The
                the latest version of Glue's door twist lock is called Smart Door Lock Pro, and looks pretty much the same from the outside
                same as the V2 model. It looks to be the exact same chassis and mechanics, a nice and sturdy aluminum frame
                with a milky white plastic cover that can be pushed to the side, and a knob with a comfortable grip.
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/gluesmart/gluesmart2.jpg" alt="Picture showing how easy it is to change the batteries" class="bloggbild">

            <p>The lock is narrow in width, but just over 13 centimeters long to accommodate four AA batteries. The
                means that you can be limited in where and how it is suitable to mount, but for the most part there is certainly an angle that
                fits. The batteries keep the lock operating for about six months at a time under normal use. What is normal
                depends on how much is passed in and out of the household.
            </p>

            <p>Installation is admittedly simple. We get a bag with inserts and screws that make the lock fit in them
                most standard Swedish doors, and after putting a bottom plate there, we attach the Glue lock on top. Are you
                unsure, there is a handy compatibility check on the Glue Homes site where you can check if your lock belongs to the
                which is supported.
            </p>

            <p>It is a bit fiddlier to do the final assembly than some other door twist locks we have tested over the years, and
                requires tightening of two small screws with a supplied hex key. It is important that you are careful when screwing in
                it evenly, otherwise there is a risk of them fitting incorrectly in their holes and being damaged.
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/gluesmart/gluesmart3.jpg" alt="The lock flashes nicely when it is active" class="bloggbild">

            <h3>Initializes and calibrates correctly</h3>

            <p>Once in place, it is then just a matter of pulling off a couple of plastic strips for already inserted batteries, charge home
                Glue the app and get started. The lock is paired with the mobile via bluetooth and connected to an account you create with
                Glue by scanning a qr code on your mobile. In a second step, you can then configure an included
                wifi gateway, as big as a fatter mobile charger that you plug into a wall socket in the hall.
            </p>

            <p>After a few minutes, everything is up and running and it's time for a first calibration of the lock. The
                works flawlessly on the two locks we have available to test Glue on, and then we lock and unlock without
                problems from within the app. When we last tested Glue, the lock had problems with two things, identifying correctly
                lock status, even when we used Glue's own knobs, and identifying whether the door is open or closed. We can do that
                state that the new version is better at
            </p>

            <p>Now we get the correct lock status in all but one situation. If our lock is of a type where the piston on the outside
                is not directly connected to the knob on the inside, and you lock or unlock manually with a key. It's something
                which no door knob lock can handle. Unlike Yale Linus, that doesn't mean you need to anyway
                recalibrate the entire lock. Just run the lock to one of its extremes so that the app's status reads as unlocked again
                the locking piston is. Then it works as it should again.
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/gluesmart/gluesmart4.jpg" alt="Image showing the appearance of the app" class="bloggbild">

            <h3>Functional but slow</h3>

            <p>You also don't need to lock from the outside when you leave. If you double press the knob which is also a button, then
                can you manage to go out and close the door, which then automatically locks behind you. That's good, because Glue really is
                not a quick-handled lock. Should you open it when you arrive, you have to wait patiently for a few seconds outside the door
                to get in. It can be good to get used to unlocking already 10-15 meters from the door.
            </p>

            <p>In the app, as the owner of the lock, you can invite others as temporary guests, permanent residents or as shared guests
                Administrator. Glue states that it can have ten users, plus the extras used for
                Inhome deliveries. It's a bit stingy, but we hope it's something that can be fixed in the future.
            </p>

            <p>The app's interface is not one hundred percent intuitive and we find ourselves trying to lock one already
                locked lock because we didn't understand which direction to swipe on the screen. A new feature in Glue Smart Lock Pro is
                Door Alert. With it, we get a warning if we have left the door unlocked for too long. It must also be connected to
                the door opening detection. After ten minutes it should warn, according to the app, but it happened after 14
                minutes for us. Then a notification came on the mobile that it might be good to check the door.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, Glue gets a small plus on the edge because they are now also available as an Apple Watch app. We have that
                haven't seen that any of the competitors have yet.
            </p>
