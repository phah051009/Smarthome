    <h1>Ikeas smart LED lights - remote control in app or with voice</h1>
    <img src="./../blogg/ikeatradfri/ikeatradfri1.jpg" alt="" class="bloggbild">

    <h3>They can be controlled using a timer, in the app or with your voice, just to name a few options</h3>

    <p>For everyone, remote-controlled lights may not be desirable, but when Ikea is now investing more in the smart home
        are the lamps that form the basis because it is smart speakers and smart roller blinds that have been added
        the growing supply. In its basic design, the smart lamp is relatively simple. A remote control sounds
        turn on and off and dim the light bulb. Depending on which lamp applies, you can also change
        color tone, between a couple of different warm and cold tones or in the case of the one who can choose more
        between about twenty colors from the entire rainbow.</p>

    <img src="./../blogg/ikeatradfri/ikeatradfri2.jpg" alt="We see a phone where Ikea's smart home app is open." class="bloggbild">

    <p>So far, the dimming function is certainly an advantage, because it works regardless of the fixture,
        but otherwise the function is much like a normal lamp with a lamp button on the wall. For more features
         and remote control requires that you invest in Ikea's gateway Wireless. It is connected directly with an ethernet cable
          to your wifi router and is the prerequisite for being able to control your lights with Ikea's app and not
          only with the help of remote control. It is also Wireless gateway that makes it possible to connect to
           Google Home/Assistant and to Apple Homekit if you want it.</p>

    <h3>Problematic installation</h3>

    <p>We have previously tested Ikea's smart roller blind and just like the roller blind, it is an Ikea Wireless gateway
        which is required to connect the lights so that they can be controlled with Ikea's mobile app and with Google
        Assistant. Just like the roller blind, the lights, remote controls and gateway are a lot of mess
        before we finally manage to get them all talking to each other. In any case, they must be connected
        by pressing a series of button presses on the remote control and then holding it inside
         two centimeters from the lamp to be connected to the system. And before that you must have connected
         Wireless gateway directly to an ethernet port on your Wifi router at home.</p>

    <img src="./../blogg/ikeatradfri/ikeatradfri4.jpg" alt="Shows a picture of how to pair lamp and remote control." class="bloggbild">

    <p>When everything is up and running, you can control the lighting from Ikea's app as long as you are connected
        the same wifi as the lights and via Google Home and Assistant in addition when you are anywhere
        where there is internet. The lights can also be controlled with a motion sensor so you can, for example
        can make the light in the storage room turn on automatically when you enter it.</p>

    <h3>Collected in app</h3>

    <p>In addition to the lamps, Ikea's app also collects the roller blind we previously tested and Ikea's speakers as a man
        launched together with Sonos. In addition to turning the lights on and off, you can also control them
        a timer function in the app. It works so that you can simulate that you are at home when you o
        the actual work is removed and it can also be set so that, for example, the lights
        slowly fades in before you wake up and so that the blinds go up when it's time to
        go up. The three different timer functions that are available are called Good Morning, Away and
        Light and darkness, but in practice all three have roughly the same function. Good morning is
        to wake you up at a specified time and because the timer will go away simulate that you are at
        home as usual when you are on a trip, it has the same function. Which makes it a bit redundant. 
        Same thing with the last timer function Light and Dark, because even it only has the basic functions
        of setting fixed times and not as one might think, some connection to when the sun rises and sets.</p>

    <h3>More opportunities at Google</h3>

    <p>Via Google Assistant, I can request that the lights be turned off or on all or each
        individually and in the Google Assistant app you can also dim or change the color of the lights based on
        on what is available in each lamp. Funnily enough, Google gives me more than twice as many
         color options like the Ikea app does with the exact same lamp. </p>
    
    <img src="./../blogg/ikeatradfri/ikeatradfri7.jpg" alt="Image showing the colors and look of the app." class="bloggbild">

    <p>In addition to these ways of controlling and managing the lights, they also support Apple Homekit, which allows you to use Siri and the Home app in the iPhone to control the lights and also that you can have the Apple Tv as something of a connection center for the lights and other smart gadgets with Homekit support. It still feels, however, that the Ikea lamps could be significantly easier for the common man to actually get to work as intended and then should have more opportunities to be controlled by various chains of events. So that they simply become a little smarter and less frustrating. </p>
