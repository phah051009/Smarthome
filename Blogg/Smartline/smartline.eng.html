            <h3>Smartline 2.0 is a flexible system that does not need a Wi-Fi connection to work.</h3>

            <h3>Price:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>E14: SEK 99 at Netonnet.</li>
                <li>E27: SEK 289 at Netonnet</li>
                <li>GU10: SEK 129 at Ginza</li>
                <li>Check: SEK 99 at Netonnet.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Smartline differs from most other smart light systems in that it does not need one
                separate hub, router or wifi to work. Instead, Smartline uses bluetooth for
                the control of the lamps and other units in the system.
            </p>

            <p>We tested the Smartline when it had just been launched and were impressed, but had reservations about it
                limited and somewhat buggy app. Now they have launched version 2.0, with a new app and a lot of new ones
                components of the system.
            </p>

            <h3>Super easy to install</h3>

            <p>Just like before, simplicity is the key word when it comes to Smartline 2.0. It is also noticeable
                right away the installation which is very fast and smooth. After downloading the app, just screw one in
                lamp, turn on the power and then add it to the system via the app. The same goes for the others
                various components that are available, such as smart sockets and the remote control.
            </p>

            <p>As I said, the range of lamps and components has been expanded since the last test. Now there is also a 
                large one here lots of filament lamps, smart sockets for both indoor and outdoor use and a led strip.
                Apart from this the spotlights, E27 and E14 lamps in white and color that you had before.
            </p>

            <p>All components are of high quality and the large selection makes it easy to find light bulbs for everyone
                the home's rooms and lamp sockets.
            </p>

            <p>Regardless of what you choose, the price is competitive. The lamps cost between SEK 100 and 200, depending
                on size and whether you want color or not. Other components are in roughly the same price range.
            </p>

            <h3>Slightly limited</h3>

            <p>Using the lights (and accessories) is also very easy. The app is in Swedish and very educational
                and clear. On the overview screen, you can see which lights/accessories are running and can switch them on/off from there
                them. If you want to dim/change the color or color temperature, you click on the lamp you want to change and do so
                then the settings on the next screen.
            </p>

            <p>Since last time, the functions have been improved to be able to control more lights and other components
                at the same time by the fact that it is now possible to create groups. For example, it can either be all lights in one
                room, part of a room or a certain type of lights from several different rooms.
            </p>

            <p>It is also possible to create scenes (you choose which lights should be switched on/off and how bright
                light and more) and set timers (so that selected lights turn on and off at a certain time).
            </p>

            <p>Everything is very educational and easy to do, but here is still one of Smartline's weaknesses. For
                the simplicity also entails certain limitations, such as the fact that it is not possible to create groups within groups, that
                the length of the names you give lights and groups are limited and so on.
            </p>

            <p>The fact that everything is run locally via bluetooth also means that it is not possible to control the system remotely. Are you coming?
                on the fact that you forgot a light at home, it is therefore not possible to turn it off when you are out on the town.
                Smartline also lacks support for, for example, Google home and Apple Homekit.
            </p>

            <p>Through a takeover of Telldus, however, the possibility of being able to remotely control via an extra connected hub will be on
                walk.
            </p>
