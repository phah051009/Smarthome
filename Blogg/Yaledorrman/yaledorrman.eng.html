    <h3>Yale Doorman's latest digital lock is really easy to use – once it's in place. It's time to
        get rid of the keys!</h3>

    <p><b>Tested Product:</b> Yale Doorman L3</p>
    <p><b>Price:</b> SEK 6,149 at Kjell & Company</p>

    <p>We previously wrote about this new lock when it was launched. Now we have had to borrow a Yale
        Doorman L3 for a proper test. This lock is slightly rounder and nicer than the predecessor that we tested
        and celebrated a couple of years ago. However, the V2N model is still sold, so what's new with the new L3 and is it
        justified to spend more than SEK 6,000 on it?</p>

        <p>The packaging might put off anyone who isn't handy, but hardware-wise it's not terribly complicated.
            It comes with a board with installation instructions in Swedish that is fairly clear. Some moments are sharp, if
            you have not previously changed the lock insert. Such as cutting screws and locking plate to the right length (metal saw and flat iron
            needed). If you're lucky the end plate you already have will fit, in our case we needed to change it to the supplied one
            as well as using the tuning iron to get it in the right place.

        <h3><b>The master code disappeared</b></h3>

        <p>But - after we installed the app, the master code we set before connecting the app no ​​longer works
            against the lock. And after the firmware update, Swedish has again been replaced by English. And we couldn't anymore
            enter the Yale lock's menu via the code buttons on the outside of the lock.
        </p>
    
        <p>Fortunately, you can access these functions in the app instead, but it would have been good to have information about this. During
            the installation, which took 2-3 hours in total, there were a couple of turns of troubleshooting for various reasons. The
            could have been avoided with clearer and more comprehensive instructions.
        </p>


    <img src="./../blogg/yaledorrman/yaledorrman2.jpg" alt="Image showing the app settings for the lock." class="bloggbild">

    <p>In the app, you manage locking and unlocking very easily. If you want to access advanced settings, you must
        connect with bluetooth, then you can also set things like automatic locking and unlocking. It is
        easy to add users, permanent or temporary. Yale Doorman L3 supports up to 30 different
        user! We are testing the "All inclusive" package, which includes a lock plate, end plate and Wi-Fi bridge.
    </p>

    <img src="./../blogg/yaledorrman/yaledorrman3.jpg" alt="Picture showing the bridge that we connect to the lock.">

    <p>A new feature of the Yale Doorman L3 is that it has a built-in doorbell. Now it doesn't sound very loud, and it is
        not sure that whoever comes to your door will notice the little button with a bell on the code panel. But it
        is a nice extra finesse and it's easy to get a notification when someone calls.
    </p>

    <h3><b>One year battery life - and emergency solution</b></h3>

    <p>The lock is powered by four AA batteries, which you can easily replace by unscrewing a screw and removing a cover
        the inner part. This is a small but nice improvement over the predecessor model, where you had to look up
        an allen key of the correct size. Most of us don't have these lying around.
    </p>

    <p>The battery life is stated at one year and you should receive a warning one month before it is time to change. Would
        battery is completely dead when you get home, you can, as an emergency solution, connect a 9-volt battery to the poles of
        the underside of the outer part. A smart feature that the predecessor also has.
    </p>

    <img src="./../blogg/yaledorrman/yaledorrman4.jpg" alt="Picture of the lock when it is mounted." class="bloggbild">

    <p>Although the installation process could have been much smoother, the Yale Doorman L3 works really well when it does
        well is in place. It is a stylish and sturdy solution that is also approved by the insurance companies (lock class 3)
        and all the important functions you need are in the app. Being able to choose to open with a token, code or mobile is
        incredibly flexible. There is also the possibility to integrate the control with Alexa, Google Assistant and IFTTT,
        but unfortunately not with Apple Homekit at the time of writing. You can also connect Yale's lock directly to yours
        Verisure alarm, if you have one, for control directly in the alarm app.
