    <h3>With Nimly's smart lock, you don't need a code, mobile app or tags for secure unlocking. Only yourself.</h3>

    <p><b>Tested product:</b> Nimly Touch Pro</p>    
    <p><b>Price, October 2022:</b> From SEK 3,795 via Prisjakt</p>

<p>The smart locks of the type with complete lock housings that we have tested are all physically very similar to each other.
        Well-designed, resistant to external damage, both break-in attempts and rain and debris, and with faultless mechanics. The
        there is a reason for that, we have high requirements for building standards here in the Nordics. It also includes front doors, and those
        lock that sits in them. So it is mostly just Nordic manufacturers that make the ones that are sold here in Sweden.
    </p>

    <p>Surprisingly many manufacturers are Norwegian, one of which is called Nimly, formerly known as Easyaccess. They just have
        came out with new versions of their smart locks, and sent us one of them to test. It's called Touch Pro and
        is the manufacturer's top model right now.
    </p>

    <p>There's also one just called Touch, but in that you miss what makes Nimly's lock stand out - access with
        biometrics. On the outside, in addition to the code lock panel and reader for key fobs, we also find a round one
        fingerprint reader. You can register up to 199 fingerprints to it, which then do not need a lock tag
        or code to enter. You also have the option to register up to 999 access codes and the whole 999
        key fobs. Three such are included in the package.
    </p>

    <p>The lock is ip65-rated so that it can withstand both fine-grained dust and rain; it must withstand between -35 and +40 degrees
        temperature with full function. We haven't been able to test if that's true for things like the fingerprint reader, though
        we have to take Nimly at his word, quite simply. It is also approved according to the Stöldskyddsföreningen's lock class 3, which can
        be a requirement from insurance companies in some cases. Like all Class 3 locks we tested, from Nimly, Yale and ID Lock,
        applies to that classification as long as it is not connected for remote control.
    </p>

    <h3>Manageable assembly</h3>

    <p>Assembling and installing the Nimly Touch Pro is not much more difficult than a regular clumsy lock. It all consists of
        an inner lock housing, a matching end plate for the door frame, and then the smart parts themselves, which are mounted on
        inside and outside. All parts are reversible to be able to mount on right- and left-swinging doors. To loosen
        the handles and turning them for different door directions is a bit fiddly, but manageable.
    </p>

    <p>If you're lucky, you have the correct location for the lock housing in the door already, and maybe even an existing end plate of
        the right type that fits, otherwise it may take some fiddling with a chisel to get it all to fit. Of course it is
        something you can have a professional do, but the lock is meant to be able to be fitted yourself if you are reasonably handy.
    </p>

    <p>We received our tested lock pre-assembled, but we tried to assemble and disassemble the outer parts, and did not encounter
        any problems. Screws and fasteners are readily available as long as you stick to Nimly's clear lines
        installation guide. We don't know if it comes with paper, but they were easy to find on the manufacturer's site.
    </p>

    <h3>Disconnected or connected</h3>
    <p>You can program the lock manually using the outside code panel, which can be a frustrating experience, as it
        involves entering long series of numbers on the outer panel keypad to create an admin account, activate
        lock tags, create numeric codes and register new fingerprints, with only cryptic flashes on the panel and
        beeping signal as an indicator that you have done right or wrong.
    </p>

    <img src="./../blogg/nimlytouch/nimlytouch3.jpg" alt="Image showing how to install a wireless connection module."
        class="bloggbild">

        <p>Nimly has a clear guide on how to go about it but it can still be easy to make mistakes, especially
            given that the keypad is a glossy touch-type surface instead of physical buttons. It also has little
            only a short time before it automatically switches off, so don't hesitate when you button yours
            instructions. The keypad is off by default to save battery, and can be a bit difficult to wake up.
        </p>

        <p>If you want to make it easy for yourself, there are two accessories to get, Nimly's network gateway, and a
            zigbee module that is installed inside the lock. Then it is possible to connect the lock to several different smart home systems,
            and above all also control it with the manufacturer's own app.
        </p>

        <p>There you can make most configurations more easily, add users with any combination of code, badge,
            app access and fingerprints, assign time-limited guest access, check the current lock status, and log in
            who locked and unlocked, and when. And of course use your mobile to unlock.
        </p>

        <h3>Room for improvement</h3>
        <p>If you add it afterwards, you should do a factory reset of the lock. Existing registered users
            will not enter the app system automatically, even if they are still in the lock and can be used. So for
            to get it right you should start from the beginning.
        </p>

    <img src="./../blogg/nimlytouch/nimlytouch4.jpg" alt="Image showing the different colors" class="bloggbild">

    <p>Nimly Touch Pro is available in two colors, where the black one is sold as a separate model called Nimly Touch Pro Ultimate
        Black. But there is no difference except the color; light or dark aluminum.
    </p>

    <p>The app has most of the important things, but there are some functions and settings in the lock that we will not
        at. Especially three functions that provide increased security. Anti-burglary function, which allows the lock to be blocked from
        login attempts after three failed code entries, camouflage feature that makes it harder to guess a code
        if you see it entered, and requirement for two-factor authentication, ie requirement for code even if you have
        key fob or fingerprint. Can Nimly supplement the app with administration of this and possibly others
        small settings we missed, it would be great.
    </p>

    <p>During everyday use, the lock is smooth. It automatically locks after closing and has unlocking in it
        the door knob on the inside instead of a separate knob. So it is only on the outside that you use a tray or
        finger to enter. You don't have to actively lock after you if you don't want to.
    </p>

    <p>The inside has a code panel, but it is only used if you really want to manually lock from the inside and turn off
        automatic unlocking when you pull down the door handle. For example, it can be good if you have dogs or small ones
        children who should not run out, but who can pull down door handles.
    </p>

    <h3>Touch panel can be annoying</h3>

 <p>If there is something we have to complain about, it is that physical buttons would have been easier to handle than touch buttons,
        both for general comfort (we've already mentioned that it may take an extra effort sometimes to wake it up), but
        also for, for example, the visually impaired. We would also have appreciated something more clear than * and # symbols. Now you write
        enter your code and a * to unlock, it's not as intuitive as if it had been, for example, a
        key symbol. However, there are minimal complaints, and whoever has the lock at home quickly gets into the right routines.
    </p>

    <img src="./../blogg/nimlytouch/nimlytouch5.jpg" alt="Picture on the smart lock" class="bloggbild">

    <p>Finally, the lock also has a keyhole on the outside that sits in the handle. With it, you can use emergency keys to
        come in, if, for example, the battery were to run out. The lock is powered by four standard AA batteries, as stated
        should last for about a year. But of course it depends on how often it is used. Changing the batteries is super easy
        with a hatch on the inside.
    </p>

    <p>With a price of SEK 4,000 for the lock itself, SEK 1,200 to SEK 1,300 in store for the gateway and SEK 600 for
        wireless module for the lock, a complete solution ends up costing well over SEK 6,000. It's the same price level
        such as the Yale Doorman L3, where all the parts come in one package.
