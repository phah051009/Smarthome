            <h3>Sonos Era 100 costs almost SEK 1,000 more than the predecessor One. Is it worth replacing yours
                existing speakers or are the differences between the models negligible? Smart home sorts out any
                question mark.</h3>

            <p>So, then it was finally time for the next generation of smart multiroom speakers from Sonos to be made
                entrance. The Era 100, which we are looking at here, as well as the slightly larger Era 300.
            </p>

            <p>The manufacturer has a solid fan base and interest in all rumours, updates and new launches
                from Sonos tends to cut through the media noise on its own without the PR machinery having to make any effort
                itself significantly.
            </p>

            <h3>Time for a sequel</h3>

            <p>And of course it's about time we get to know a couple of new speakers designed for listening to music in
                the home and which do not belong to the "home theater" or "portable audio" categories. The latest generation of
                The Sonos One saw the light of day already in 2017 and the third edition of the full-sized Five for just about three
                years ago. Then we shouldn't forget to mention the now defunct Play:3 launched in 2011, which never
                got any real followers. Until now, if we can now call the new Era 300 a successor to the Play:3.
            </p>

            <p>Era 100 thus replaces both Sonos One and One SL. Although these outgoing models will exist
                for sale for a while longer, i.e. as long as they are in stock, so it is time to say
                say goodbye to a couple of stalwarts and embrace the new age speakers. Whether it even will
                whether a simpler SL variant of the Era 100 without voice control will be launched in the future remains to be seen.
            </p>

            <p>So what are the news that the Era 100 offers and what is the difference compared to its predecessor? It is about to begin
                with slightly larger (182.5 x 130.5 x 120 millimeters compared to 161.5 x 120 x 120 millimeters) as well as a
                couple of hecto heavier. The Era 100 also has a more cylindrical shape and a reasonably changed layout
                the touch controls on the top of the device, mainly the volume control which is used by swiping
                finger against the surface.
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/sonosera100/sonosera1002.jpg" alt="Image showing the top of the loudspeaker" class="bloggbild">

            <p>On the back there is a usb-c port that can be used to connect an external audio source via a 3.5 mm aux cable
                alternatively to connect the speaker via network cable to your router. No matter what you need to buy
                to an adapter (line input adapter for SEK 269 or a combi-adapter SEK 499).</p>

            <h3>Now with bluetooth and wifi 6</h3>

            <p>Support for wifi 6, or wifi 802.11ax, the latest standard for wireless internet is of course good, even
                if you need a state-of-the-art router to use this, of course it means an advantage in the form of
                improved stability and longer range. You can also stream music to the Era 100 via bluetooth, perhaps
                not the most revolutionary technical innovation in the context but still useful if you want, for example
                take the speaker with you to a place that does not have the possibility of a Wi-Fi connection.
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/sonosera100/sonosera1003.jpg" alt="picture showing how the sonos app looks like" class="bloggbild">

            <p>Well, the actual installation process of the speaker is no different from before, as soon as you provided
                speaker with power, it is found within a few seconds in the app and connected to your home network.
                After that, you can then name it as well as place it in an already existing Sonos configuration, if
                you have one at home. The app itself is clear and easy to use. Like the others
                Sonos speakers support Era 100 Spotify Connect, which further simplifies management.
            </p>

            <p>If you have another Era 100, you can, just like with Sonos One and Sonos Five (or for that matter also
                IKEA Symfonisk lamps) create a true stereo pair with separated left and right channels or use
                them as surround speakers in a home cinema system - just as most people use their One speakers.
                Unfortunately, we initially only received one speaker for testing, so we will simply have to come back later
                regarding these functions.
            </p>

            <h3>Now even Android users can Trueplay-calibrate the sound</h3>

            <p>For optimal playback quality, you can use Sonos' "Trueplay" function to optimize the playback sound
                depending on how the room the speaker is placed looks like. The feature itself is not new but has been around before
                required an iOS device and its built-in microphones.
            </p>

            <p>Now you too with an Android device can optimize the sound, although not fully, but you have to settle for
                the so-called quick adjustment in the app, where the system uses the speakers' built-in microphones instead
                to read the room. The traditional method or "advanced adjustment" is still limited
                to you with an iPhone or iPad. I try both variants and can honestly say I don't notice
                any difference between the results - congratulations to all Android users!
            </p>

            <img src="./../blogg/sonosera100/sonosera1004.jpg" alt="Picture showing the slider on the speaker" class="bloggbild">

            <p>If you want to voice control the speaker, it is Sonos' own assistant, Sonos Voice Control, or Amazon Alexa
                which concerns. Google Assistant, which was previously offered (and is still offered for Sonos One in particular) is available
                thus not available at the moment. Whether support for this will be implemented later or
                not is unclear at the time of writing.
            </p>

            <p>The equipment consists of a larger woofer than the one in the Sonos One and two angled tweeters. Earlier
                only a forward tweeter was used. This results in a clearly wider and improved sound experience
                stereo experience. It can hardly be compared to a true stereo configuration with two paired
                speakers, but when I compare the new Era 100 side by side with the One, I experience a marked difference.
                In addition to clearly better volume resources, as well as a more vital and more present upper midrange,
                the Era 100 delivers a deeper, heavier bass with significantly more "oomph" compared to its predecessor.
            </p>

            <h3>Time to replace One or One SL?</h3>

            <p>So is this a speaker you just have to get your hands on? Yes, have you already planned to expand yours
                already existing systems with another one or a couple of smaller units or just starting to think about
                stepping into the Sonos ecosystem is a no-brainer (provided you don't find any of those
                outgoing models at scrap price). The Sonos Era 100 delivers – they're good-looking, great-sounding and have an equal
                simple and user-friendly interface. Just like the other members of the Sonos family have.
            </p>

            <p>But are they so good and innovative that you have to immediately retire your existing One or One SL?
                Absolutely not!
            </p>
