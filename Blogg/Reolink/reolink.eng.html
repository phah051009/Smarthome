            <h3>The Reolink Duo 4G camera allows you to monitor remotely without wifi.</h3>
            <img src="./../blogg/reolink/reolink1.jpg" alt="Picture on reolink camera." class="bloggbild">

            <p>Reolink Duo 4G really has a different look. The dual cameras look like a pair of eyes and with
                the ear-like antennae make it look like some kind of flying robot from a Star Wars movie.
            </p>
            <p>But the dual cameras make it not only special in terms of appearance, but also in terms of functionality. Thanks to
                these allow it to monitor a much larger area, without the disturbing "fisheye distortion" that other
                cameras with a high angle of view have, because they are two separate images. If you watch live, these two images can
                placed next to each other and appear as a single image (albeit with a strange joint in the middle). That which
                is recorded, however, is saved as two separate files.
            </p>

            <h3>4g connection only</h3>
            <p>As the name suggests, the Reolink Duo 4G connects via the 4g network, just like the recently tested Arlo Go 2. But
                in contrast to this, the Reolink Duo 4G cannot be connected via wifi, here only 4g applies.
            </p>

            <p>However, this is not a major problem. The main reason you get a surveillance camera with
                4g connection is, of course, that you lack an internet connection with an associated router and wifi
                the summer cottage, or wherever you want to monitor. But it would have been handy with wifi if you had one later
                occasion want to use the camera in a place that actually has it.
            </p>

            <p>The installation of the Reolink Duo 4G also goes smoothly, at least when it comes to inserting the SIM card
                and connect to the 4g network. The actual physical installation is more involved. For unlike against
                small flexible Arlo Go 2, which can be placed anywhere, the Reolink Duo 4G is a large and heavy lump that
                must be ceiling or wall mounted. So expect some drilling and screwing.
            </p>

            <p>Once in place, the Reolink Duo 4G works great without being connected to mains power, but must be understood
                taken down and loaded at regular intervals. A convenient way to avoid this (or to risk that
                the battery dies when you are far from the summer house) is to get a solar panel to connect to
                the camera. Such a solar panel is purchased separately and costs approximately SEK 370.
            </p>

            <h3>Featured</h3>

            <p>The app for the Reolink Duo 4G is in Swedish and is easy to use, even though it is a lot at the same time
                functional. Here is basically everything you could want from an app for a surveillance camera. Everything from
                from choosing picture quality to choosing settings for the motion detector and where and how the videos should be
                is saved.
            </p>

            <p>These movies can be saved either on a micro SD card in the camera (up to 128 GB) and/or in a
                cloud storage. Exactly what and how can be saved in the cloud depends on which subscription you choose. These different
                subscription is something that is both positive and negative for Reolink Duo 4G.
            </p>

            <p>The positive thing is that there is a free subscription which is actually quite okay. This includes a camera, 1
                gb storage and seven days of video history.
            </p>

            <p>The negative is that the other subscription forms are messy and difficult to understand. Here there are as well
                "classic" and "upgraded" subscriptions in different "standard" and "premium" variants. We're not going
                through them all here, but content ourselves with stating that the more you pay, the more space and
                longer storage you get (in principle).
            </p>

            <h3>Very good picture</h3>

            <p>How well Reolink Duo 4G works depends of course on how good the 4g connection is where it is used. But with one
                okay connection Reolink Duo 4G works very well. The image, which can be obtained in up to 2560 x 1440
                pixel resolution, is razor sharp, whether it is daylight, lamplight or light from them
                built-in headlights. We do not experience any disturbing delay (similar to that of the Arlo Go 2) either.
            </p>

            <p>Admittedly, it looks a little strange if a person is right in the middle of the camera lenses,
                but it's not a big problem. Nor that what is recorded is saved as two separate ones
                files.
            </p>

            <p>The only final small objection we have is the price tag of SEK 3,700 (plus SEK 370 if you want a
                solar panel). However, for this money you get a really good 4g surveillance camera.
            </p>
